![leetcode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27ddf194-43f5-49dd-a4b6-d50504d3dfe8)

## Inspiration

The repository documents my ongoing journey through LeetCode, where I aim to solve one problem every week. The goal is to gradually build proficiency, improve coding efficiency, and develop a deeper understanding of core algorithms and data structures. 

## Challenges

One of the most significant challenges has been devising efficient solutions for complex problems, not just solving them, but doing so in a way that meets performance constraints and scales well.

## Lessons Learned

Through consistent practice, I've learned to:

- Break down complex problems into mangeable sub-problems
- Identify patterns across different types of challenges
- Choose the right data structures and algorithms for the task at hand

## The Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, implemented in:

- C++ (primary language, currently used for most submissions)
- Python
- JavaScript

I focus primarily on C++ to reinforce my understanding of its syntax, standard library, and performance characteristics.
