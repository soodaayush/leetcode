# https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/

# There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except
# for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a
# locked room without having its key.

# When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has
# a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them
# with you to unlock the other rooms.

# Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if
# you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false
# otherwise.

# Time Complexity: O(n + e) e - edge
# Space Complexity: O(n)
