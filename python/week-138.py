# https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/

# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p
# and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a
# descendant of itself).”

# Definition for a binary tree node.
