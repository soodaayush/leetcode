# https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/

# Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color
# are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

# We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

# You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
