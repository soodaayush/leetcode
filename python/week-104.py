# https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/

# Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the
# functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

# Implement the MyQueue class:

#     void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
#     int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
#     int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
#     boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

# Notes:
#     You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is
#     empty operations are valid.
#     Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or
#     deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.queue.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        first_el = self.queue[0]
        self.queue = self.queue[1:]
        return first_el

    def peek(self) -> int:
        return self.queue[0]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        if len(self.queue) > 0:
            return False
        else:
            return True

# Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyQueue()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.peek()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
