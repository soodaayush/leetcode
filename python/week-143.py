# https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/

# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

# The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two
# nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

# The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
